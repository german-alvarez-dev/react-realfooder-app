## About the API

You will need to use an API based on the `https://reactr-realfooder.herokuapp.com/api` URL, containing the following endpoints:

 | Path        | Method           | JSON response  |
  | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
  | `/countries` | GET | All available countries  |
  | `/foods`  | GET | All products  |
  | `/foods/details/:id` | GET | ID matching product's details  |
  | `/foods/newFood` | POST | Create new product  |
  | `/foods/edit/:id` | PUT | Edit ID matching product  |
  | `/foods/delete/:id` | DELETE | Delete ID matching product  |
  
  
## Users available

You already have two users on the database. Use them to make any test you need: 
- **User 1** (username: `User 1`, pwd: `user 1`, origin `spain`)
- **User 2** (username: `User 2`, pwd: `user 2`, origin `france`)


## Product reboot

Have you created a bunch of foods that makes the application hard to manage? No worries! 

In case you need to reboot the foods <a href="https://reactr-realfooder.herokuapp.com/api/foods/reboot">proceed here</a>. The foods collection will be dropped and seeded with the default set of products.
